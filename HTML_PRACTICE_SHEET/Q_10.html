        <abbr title="is markup language">HTML</abbr> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
        constructs, images and other objects such
        as interactive forms may be embeded into the rendered page. <br>
        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        <i><b>headings,paragraphs,links,lists,quotes and other items</b></i>. <br>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <u>angle brackets</u>. Tags such as <code
            style="color:green">&lt;img/&gt;</code> and <code style="color:green">&lt;
        input/ &gt;</code> directle introduce content into the page. <br>
        Other tags such as &lt; p &gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags
        as sub-elements. <br>
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
